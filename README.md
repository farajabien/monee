# **MONEE – Your Money, Finally in One Place**

Most of us _think_ we know where our money goes… until the end of the month, when it's gone — leaving only screenshots of payments and good intentions.

**MONEE** is your simple, personal money assistant — built for real life in Kenya 🇰🇪 and beyond.
It helps you **track, understand, and plan your money** — all in one calm, habit-forming routine.

## **Why MONEE Exists**

Most people buy 5–6 different spreadsheets or templates just to manage different parts of their life: budget tracker, debt tracker, business expenses, student budgets, savings goals… each costing KSh 400–800.

**That's KSh 3,500+ for disconnected files that don't sync, don't talk to each other, and require manual updates.**

**MONEE replaces them all — for just KSh 999, one time.**

Instead of juggling multiple spreadsheets, you get one app that does everything:
- Zero-sum budgeting
- Debt tracking with interest calculations
- Savings goals with progress tracking
- Business/side-hustle expense tagging
- Student academic expense tracking
- Mpesa auto-import and smart categorization
- Cloud sync, offline-first, and works on any device

**MONEE** is about **awareness, control, and saving**, not spreadsheets. By recording your transactions daily, weekly, or monthly, you start seeing where your money goes — and make sure every shilling is accounted for.

## **The Better Deal**

Here's what you'd pay for separate tools vs. getting everything in Monee:

| **Business/Inventory** | KSh 799 | ✅ Included |
| **Student Planner** | KSh 399 | ✅ Included |

| **Total** | **KSh 3,395+** | **KSh 999** |

**Plus with Monee you get:**
- Cloud sync across devices (spreadsheets don't sync)
- Mpesa auto-import (no copy-pasting)
- Smart recipient matching (see where money _really_ goes)
- Offline-first (works without internet)
- One habit, complete picture (not 6 different files)

## **How It Works**

**Set it up once, use it daily.**

Monee is designed to be lightweight and habit-forming. You spend 10 minutes setting up your income, recurring budgets, debts, and savings goals — then you just record your one-time daily expenses as they happen.

The secret? **Recipient nicknames** and **auto-matching**.

Instead of seeing "KPLC TOKENS" or "NAIVAS SUPERMARKET LTD", you nickname them "Electricity" or "Groceries". Once saved, Monee auto-categorizes future transactions from that recipient. You start to see _exactly_ where your money goes — because what eats your budget is those daily small purchases.

Stop seeing "MERCHANT CODE 12345" and start seeing "Coffee Shop" or "Uber". You'll finally understand where your money _actually_ goes.

Other apps show you budgets. Monee tells you: "At your current rate, you'll run out on Nov 25 (3 days before payday)". Adjust before it's too late.

### **3. Set Once, Use Daily**
No complex setup every month. Set your recurring income and budgets once, then just record daily expenses. That's it.

Paste Mpesa messages or upload statements. Monee auto-imports, auto-categorizes, and learns your spending patterns.

### **5. Offline-First, Cloud-Synced**
Record expenses on your phone without internet. Syncs automatically when you're back online. Works across all your devices.
