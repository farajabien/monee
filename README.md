# **MONEE – Your Money, Finally in One Place**

Most of us _think_ we know where our money goes… until the end of the month, when it's gone — leaving only screenshots of payments and good intentions.

**MONEE** is your simple, personal money assistant — built for real life in Kenya 🇰🇪 and beyond.
It helps you **track, understand, and plan your money** — all in one calm, habit-forming routine.

---

## **Why MONEE Exists**

Most people buy 5–6 different spreadsheets or templates just to manage different parts of their life: budget tracker, debt tracker, business expenses, student budgets, savings goals… each costing KSh 400–800.

**That's KSh 3,500+ for disconnected files that don't sync, don't talk to each other, and require manual updates.**

**MONEE replaces them all — for just KSh 999, one time.**

Instead of juggling multiple spreadsheets, you get one app that does everything:

- Zero-sum budgeting with visual analytics
- Debt tracking with interest calculations and payment progress
- Savings goals with contribution tracking and milestone celebrations
- Business/side-hustle expense tagging
- Student academic expense tracking
- Smart notifications for daily check-ins, debt reminders, and payday alerts
- Optional M-Pesa auto-import and smart categorization
- Visual insights with charts and breakdowns for all modules
- Cloud sync, offline-first, and works on any device

**MONEE** is about **awareness, control, and saving**, not spreadsheets. By recording your transactions daily, weekly, or monthly, you start seeing where your money goes — and make sure every shilling is accounted for.

## **How It Works**

**Set it up once, use it daily.**

Monee is designed to be lightweight and habit-forming. You spend 10 minutes setting up your income, recurring budgets, debts, and savings goals — then you just record your one-time daily expenses as they happen.

The secret? **Recipient nicknames** and **auto-matching**.

Instead of seeing "KPLC TOKENS" or "NAIVAS SUPERMARKET LTD", you nickname them "Electricity" or "Groceries". Once saved, Monee auto-categorizes future transactions from that recipient. You start to see _exactly_ where your money goes — because what eats your budget is those daily small purchases.

## **What Makes Monee Different**

### **1. Recipient Nicknames = Real Insight**

Stop seeing "MERCHANT CODE 12345" and start seeing "Coffee Shop" or "Uber". You'll finally understand where your money _actually_ goes.

### **2. Cash Runway Prediction**

Other apps show you budgets. Monee tells you: "At your current rate, you'll run out on Nov 25 (3 days before payday)". Adjust before it's too late.

### **3. Set Once, Use Daily**

No complex setup every month. Set your recurring income and budgets once, then just record daily expenses. That's it.

### **4. Smart Notifications That Build Habits**

Get personalized reminders at your preferred time. Debt payment alerts keep you on track. Payday notifications help you plan. Weekly savings nudges build consistency. All configurable to your preferences.

### **5. Visual Insights**

See your financial data come to life with charts and analytics. Track trends over time, understand category breakdowns, and visualize your progress toward goals.

### **6. M-Pesa Integration (Optional)**

For Kenyan users: paste M-Pesa messages or upload statements. MONEE auto-imports, auto-categorizes, and learns your spending patterns. Not required — manual entry works perfectly too.

### **7. Offline-First, Cloud-Synced**

Record expenses on your phone without internet. Syncs automatically when you're back online. Works across all your devices.

### **8. All-In-One**

Budget, debts, savings, business expenses, student costs, analytics, notifications — one app, one price, one habit.
