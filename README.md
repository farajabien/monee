# **MONEE – Your Money, Finally in One Place**

Most of us _think_ we know where our money goes.
Until the end of the month, when it’s gone — and we’re left with screenshots of Mpesa messages and good intentions.

**MONEE** is your simple, personal money assistant — built for real life in Kenya 🇰🇪.
It helps you **track, understand, and plan your money** — all in one beautiful daily ritual.

---

## **Why MONEE Exists**

Budgeting tools often feel too complicated, too Western, or too disconnected from how we actually live and spend.

But for most of us, our money flows through one place: **Mpesa**.

Every transaction tells a story — rent, food, house help, little treats, and all the “I’ll just buy this quickly” moments that add up.

**MONEE** brings all that together and helps you finally _see_ your financial reality — clearly, gently, and honestly.

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Start by Uploading Your Mpesa Statement**

You can upload your Mpesa statement or paste your recent messages.
MONEE automatically reads and groups your transactions — showing where your money actually goes.

You can then label them easily — rent, transport, food, or personal care — and MONEE will remember those labels for next time.

---

### **2. Record As You Go**

Each time you spend or send money, just copy the Mpesa message into MONEE.
It instantly detects the amount, who you paid, and what it’s for.

If it’s someone you’ve paid before (like Grace, your house cleaner), it automatically tags it for you — no setup needed.
If not, you can assign a new label in seconds.

---

### **3. Your Evening Money Check-In**

Every evening, MONEE gives you a gentle nudge — a push notification that says:

> “Did you record today’s spending?”

You open MONEE, paste all your Mpesa messages for the day, and it sorts them out for you.
Matched ones are ticked automatically. The rest you can quickly label or ignore.

It becomes a peaceful 2-minute routine — your daily pause to check how you’re doing financially.

---

### **4. See Your Monthly Reality**

As you keep recording, MONEE shows a clear picture of where your money goes — by category, by person, by week.

No spreadsheets. No math. Just calm, simple insights that help you understand:

- How much you actually spend on food or transport
- Which people or shops you send money to most
- How much you’re saving (or not saving) each month

---

### **5. Every Little Thing I Want (ELTIW)**

Sometimes, budgeting isn't about cutting costs — it's about taking care of yourself.

That's why MONEE includes a soft, personal space called **Every Little Thing I Want**.

It's a simple list where you write down _everything you want for yourself_:

> "New shoes – Ksh 3,000"
> "Skincare restock – Ksh 1,200"
> "Weekend getaway – Ksh 4,500"

You can add a reason or goal, but you don't have to.
When you finally buy it, you just tap **"Got it"** — and MONEE celebrates with you. 🎉

It's not just about money — it's about self-care, priorities, and giving yourself permission to enjoy what you've worked for.

---

### **6. Track Your Income**

Money doesn't just go out — it comes in too. MONEE helps you see the full picture.

**Multiple Income Sources**: Add all your income streams — salary, freelance work, side hustles, rental income, or anything else. Each source has its own name and amount.

**Payday Tracking**: Set when you get paid for each income source. MONEE remembers your paydays and helps you plan around them.

**Monthly Income View**: See your total expected income for the month at a glance. Compare it to your actual spending to understand your financial health.

**Income vs Expenses**: In your monthly insights, MONEE shows you the balance — how much you're earning versus how much you're spending. It's the simple math that helps you make better decisions.

---

### **7. Manage Your Debts**

Debts don't have to be stressful — they just need to be organized.

**Debt List**: Track all your debts in one place — loans, credit cards, money you owe friends, or any other obligations. Each debt has a name, total amount, and current balance.

**Monthly Payment Rules**: Set up recurring payment rules for each debt. Tell MONEE how much you pay each month and when the payment is due. MONEE will remind you and help you stay on track.

**Payment Tracking**: Mark payments as made when you pay them. MONEE keeps a history of all your payments, so you can see your progress over time.

**Debt Progress**: See how much you've paid off and how much remains. MONEE shows you a clear timeline of when you'll be debt-free, giving you motivation to keep going.

**Debt Tab**: A dedicated space in your dashboard where all your debt information lives — organized, clear, and manageable.
