# **MONEE – Your Money, Finally in One Place**

Most of us _think_ we know where our money goes… until the end of the month, when it’s gone — leaving only screenshots of payments and good intentions.

**MONEE** is your simple, personal money assistant — built for real life in Kenya 🇰🇪 and beyond.
It helps you **track, understand, and plan your money** — all in one calm, habit-forming routine.

## **Why MONEE Exists**

Budgeting tools are often too complicated, disconnected from reality, or boring.

**MONEE** is about **awareness, control, and saving**, not spreadsheets. By recording your transactions daily, weekly, or monthly, you start seeing where your money goes — and make sure every shilling is accounted for.
