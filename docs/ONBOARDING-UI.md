✅ Monee Onboarding Flow (Final UX Structure)

1. Sign in with Magic Code (Instant, no password)

Email

One-time code

Auto-login

Goal: frictionless entry.

2. Setup Categories (Spending Buckets)

Ask the user to choose or edit categories like:

Food

Transport

Rent

Entertainment

Personal

Misc

Goal: customize how money will be tracked.

UX Tip:
Show 8–10 default categories with a few toggles and let them reorder.

3. Setup Income Sources + Paydays

Ask:

“Where do you get your money from?”
(Salary, business, allowance, freelance)

Amount

Frequency (monthly, weekly, irregular)

Payday(s)

Goal: structure their flow of money.

Why this matters:
Setting paydays early enables payday-based budgeting and automatic resets.

4. Setup Recurring Expenses

Ask:

Rent

WiFi

Transport top-ups

Phone bundles

Subscriptions

Loan repayments

Goal: know what automatically eats into their money.

UX Tip:
Show estimated monthly total at the bottom.

5. Redirect to Overview (Personalized Dashboard)

Now their dashboard shows:

Remaining money for the month
