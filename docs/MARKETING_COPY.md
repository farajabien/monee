### Feature Highlight Email (Post-Launch Nurture)

**Subject:** Your money runway: Will you make it to payday?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question: Do you know if you'll run out of money before your next paycheck?

Most budgeting apps show you totals. Monee tells you the truth.

The Cash Runway card shows:
📊 How much you have left
📅 Days until payday
💰 Your daily average spending
↕️ Discipline indicator (are you overspending or staying on track?)
🔮 Predicted balance on payday

Real example from a Monee user:

"I saw I had KSh 12,000 left but was spending KSh 1,200/day. Monee showed me I'd run out 4 days before payday. I adjusted, cut back on takeout, and made it with KSh 2,500 to spare."

That's the power of knowing before it's too late.

One payment. KSh 999. Lifetime access.

Stay informed,

### LinkedIn Post (Professional Angle)

```
Most Kenyans spend KSh 3,000+ buying separate tools to track budgets, debts, savings, and business expenses.

We built Monee to change that.

For KSh 999 (one-time), you get:
• Mpesa auto-import & smart categorization
• Zero-sum budgeting
• Debt payoff tracking with progress visualization
• Savings goals with contribution tracking
• Cash runway predictions (know if you'll make it to payday)
• Business expense tagging for side-hustlers
• Student mode for academic expense tracking

No monthly fees. Lifetime access. Built for real life in Kenya.

The problem with buying separate spreadsheets:
❌ They don't sync across devices
❌ No auto-import from Mpesa
❌ Manual calculations take hours
❌ No smart insights or predictions
❌ You're juggling 5-6 different files

Monee solves all of this in one lightweight, offline-first app.

Early access: monee.co.ke
