## Content Breakdown (8 videos)

### 1–5. Demo-led clarity videos (core)
*Purpose: Show how simple Monee is to use.*

**Video Ideas:**

1.  **"If tracking money feels like work, this is why."**
    *   Visual: Add an expense → total updates → close app.
    *   Voiceover: "Most apps want your life story. Monee just wants the number."

2.  **"This is how I track money without spreadsheets."**
    *   Visual: Income in → expense out → done.
    *   Voiceover: "Spreadsheets are great, until you have to open them."

3.  **"No setup. No rules. Just money in, money out."**
    *   Visual: App launch to entry in seconds.
    *   Voiceover: "Stop maintaining a system. Start tracking your money."

4.  **"Tracking debts shouldn't be awkward."**
    *   Visual: Add a 'Friend Loan' or 'Shylock' debt → see balance.
    *   Voiceover: "Lent money to a friend? Track it here so you don't forget, without the awkward text."

5.  **"Stop buying things you forgot you wanted."**
    *   Visual: Add item to Wishlist (ELTIW) → Mark as 'Got'.
    *   Voiceover: "The thoughtful way to spend. Save it to your wishlist, buy it when you're ready."

*(Alternates: "This takes less than 10 seconds", "I stopped using finance apps that need tutorials.")*

### 6–7. Bridge videos (context, not selling)
*Purpose: Connect pain → solution.*

**Video Ideas:**

6.  **"Spreadsheets fail because they ask too much."**
    *   Show Monee doing the same job simply.
    *   "You’re not bad with money. You just don’t see it."

7.  **"Managing debts used to be a mess."**
    *   Visual: Scrolling through a clear list of who owes you what.
    *   Soft mention: "I built this because I lost track of too many loans."

### 8. Direct sales video (pin this)
*Purpose: Convert ready viewers.*

**Structure:**
*   **Hook:** "If you’ve tried spreadsheets and quit..."
*   **Demo:** 10–15s rapid demo showing Expenses, Debts, and Wishlist.
*   **Clear CTA:** "$10 one-time. Link in bio."
*   *Note: This stays pinned all month.*

## Posting Schedule
*   2 videos per week
*   Post on the same 2 days each week (consistency > volume)
*   Pin the sales video

## Performance Expectations
*   **Week 1–2:** Saves, profile visits
*   **Week 3–4:** Clicks → Purchases
*   *Don’t judge success on virality — judge on transactions.*

## Creator Brief (Updated)

**Project:** Short demo videos for a simple money tracker app (Monee)

**Goal:** Show how simple and fast it is to track money — no spreadsheets, no setup. Highlight that it handles **Debts** and **Wishlists** too, not just expenses.

**Video Format:**
*   15–30 seconds
*   Screen recording of the app
*   Calm, clear voice-over
*   Minimal text overlays

**Tone:**
*   Relatable
*   Simple
*   Not salesy
*   No hype

**What to Show (Mix & Match):**
*   Adding income or expense (Speed).
*   Totals updating instantly.
*   **Tracking a Debt:** Showing "I Owe" vs "Owed to Me".
*   **Wishlist:** Adding an item to buy later.
*   Closing the app quickly.

**What to Avoid:**
*   Over-explaining features.
*   Complex financial terms (ROI, Net Worth, etc.).
*   Loud music or fast, jarring cuts.

**Volume:**
8 videos this month (2 per week).

*Note: Most videos should not sell directly. Only one video will include a clear $10 CTA.*

## Decision Rule (After Month 1)

After 30 days, ask:
1.  Are people clicking the bio?
2.  Are purchases happening?
3.  Which videos lead to saves/comments?

**Then decide:**
*   Add doodle content?
*   Scale demos?
*   Change creator?

*No guessing. Just data.*
