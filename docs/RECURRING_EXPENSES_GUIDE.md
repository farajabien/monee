# Recurring Expenses - User Guide

## ✨ What's New

Your Monee app now has smart recurring expense management! Set up expenses that happen regularly (rent, subscriptions, utilities) and record payments with just one tap.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Create Recurring Expenses**
When adding any expense, toggle "Make this a recurring expense" to set it up:
- **Frequency**: Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, or Annually
- **Next Due Date**: When the next payment is due
- **Reminders**: Get notified X days before it's due (coming soon)

### 2. **One-Tap Payment Recording**
- View all your recurring expenses in one place
- See what's due soon or overdue at a glance
- Click **"Mark as Paid"** to instantly:
  - Record the expense
  - Update the next due date automatically
  - Keep your expense history accurate

### 3. **Smart Management**
- **Pause** recurring expenses temporarily (e.g., paused subscriptions)
- **Edit** details anytime (amount, frequency, payment details)
- **Track** payment history through linked expenses

## 📱 How to Use

### Creating a Recurring Expense

1. **Add New Expense** (Quick Add or Manual Entry)
2. Fill in the details:
   - Amount
   - Recipient/Description
   - Category
   - Date (today by default)
3. Toggle **"Make this a recurring expense"** ✅
4. Set:
   - How often it repeats
   - When it's next due
   - Reminder preference (optional)
5. **Submit** - Both the expense AND recurring record are created

### Recording Payments

1. Go to **Recurring Expenses** page
2. Find the expense (overdue and due-soon items are highlighted)
3. Click **"Mark as Paid"**
4. Done! ✨ 
   - Expense recorded
   - Next due date calculated automatically
   - Your budget and analytics updated

### Pausing/Resuming

- Click the **⋮** menu on any recurring expense
- Select **"Pause"** to temporarily stop tracking
- Select **"Resume"** when you want to restart
- Paused items won't show in the active list

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Best Practices
- ✅ Create recurring expenses for anything that happens regularly
- ✅ Use descriptive names ("Netflix Subscription" not just "Netflix")
- ✅ Set reminder days for important bills
- ✅ Review your recurring list monthly
- ✅ Pause instead of delete (you might restart it)

### Examples

**Rent**: Monthly, due on the 1st
**Netflix**: Monthly, due on the 15th  
**Gym Membership**: Monthly, due on the 5th
**Internet Bill**: Monthly, due on the 20th
**Water Bill**: Quarterly, due every 3 months
**Insurance Premium**: Annually, due once a year

## 🔄 How It Works Behind the Scenes

1. **Recurring Transaction Record**: Stores the template (amount, frequency, due date)
2. **Linked Expenses**: Each payment creates a new expense record
3. **Auto-Calculation**: Next due date calculated based on frequency
4. **Smart Filtering**: Shows active, paused, or all items

## 📊 Coming Soon

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Currently supports basic frequencies (weekly, monthly, etc.)
- Custom patterns (e.g., "every 2 months") coming soon
- Bulk "Mark as Paid" not yet available
- Payment history requires navigating to Expenses page

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: I marked something as paid, but don't see the expense**
A: Check your Expenses list - it's there! Filter by date or category.

**Q: Can I change the amount each time?**
A: Currently, it uses the set amount. Edit the recurring record if it changes permanently, or manually add an expense for one-off variations.

**Q: What if I miss a payment?**
A: Just mark it as paid whenever you do pay. The next due date adjusts from the current date.

**Q: Can I delete a recurring expense?**
A: Not yet, but you can pause it indefinitely. Delete feature coming soon!
