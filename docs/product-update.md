# ✅ **MONEE PRODUCT UPDATE — CLEAN, DETAILED VERSION**

## **1. Shift Messaging Away From M-Pesa as the Core Focus**

We’re no longer positioning Monee as an “M-Pesa tracking app.”
M-Pesa becomes **just one feature**, not the identity of the product.

### **New Messaging Principles:**

- Monee is **a personal finance companion**, not an M-Pesa parser.
- Manual flow is **simple, fast, and intuitive**, so users don’t _need_ M-Pesa integration to get value.
- M-Pesa is optional — it helps users clean or analyze large transaction histories, but day-to-day usage works beautifully without it.
- Users who want to understand their last 3–6 months can use the **Analyzer Tool** (lead magnet).

### **Core Feature Positioning:**

- M-Pesa parsing = convenience
- Manual entry = the habit
- Analyzer = clarity and insights

---

## **2. Free Analyzer = Lead Magnet**

We will build the **Free Analyzer** as a standalone feature to attract new users.

### **Analyzer Purpose:**

- User uploads a 3-day, 7-day, or monthly statement.
- Monee summarizes their spending into clean charts and categories.
- Perfect for “Monday panic” content.
- This becomes a viral entry point for new users.

### **Deliverables:**

- Tabbed analytics (bar charts, pie charts, day-by-day breakdown).
- Clear summaries for:

  - Top spending categories
  - Highest single transaction
  - Daily burn rate
  - Weekend damage
  - Month-on-month comparison (coming soon)

---

## **3. Remove Landing Page Access Inside the PWA**

When the user is inside the Monee PWA:

- The landing page must be inaccessible.
- Any attempt to visit the landing URL should redirect to the website (browser mode), NOT inside the PWA.
- The app must always auto-login or show login immediately.

### **Goal:**

Ensure the PWA behaves like a native app, not a website.

---

## **4. Updated Pricing Model**

We are finalizing a two-plan model:

### **🌟 1. Monthly Plan — KES 199/month**

- Full access
- Auto-renew
- Cancel anytime

### **🌟 2. Lifetime Deal — KES 999 (one-time)**

- Full access forever
- Limited launch offer
- _Value estimation:_

  - True worth: KES 10,000–15,000
  - This makes 999 feel like a once-in-lifetime deal.

### **Key Messaging:**

“The smartest money app in Kenya — for less than the price of lunch.”

---

## **5. Push Notifications (Settings Toggles)**

We need a Push Notification Settings section with user-controlled toggles.

### **Notification Types:**

1. **Daily Expense Reminder**
   “Log today’s expenses.”

2. **Debt Due Dates**

   - Payment reminders
   - Overdue alerts

3. **Payday Reminder**
   “Salary incoming” or “Payday tomorrow.”

4. **Savings Reminders**

   - Daily/weekly reminders
   - Target reached
   - Encouragement notifications

5. **Burn Rate Warning (Amount per day meter)**

   - User sets their allowed daily spending
   - If spending is about to exceed the threshold, notify them
   - If they are below the threshold, reinforce positive behavior

---

## **6. Add Analytics for All Modules**

Expenses already have analytics.
We now need analytics for:

### **Debts**

- Amount owed over time
- Payoff progress
- Monthly payments
- Largest debts
- Interest impact (if applicable)

### **Savings**

- Savings growth chart
- Targets vs actual
- Monthly progress
- Missed months
- Long-term trend

### **Income**

- Month-by-month income
- Income source breakdown
- Best months
- Growth/decline

---

## **7. Transform Landing Page — App Download Funnel**

The landing page becomes a **“Download the App Now” funnel**.

### **New Landing Structure:**

- Hero:

  - App mockups
  - “Free to download”
  - “1-week free trial”

- Short explanations of features:

  - Tracking
  - Budgeting
  - Debts
  - Savings
  - Analyzer (highlight as free)

- CTA buttons linking to PWA install instructions
- Placeholder images/screenshots from the app

### **Goal:**

Move from “explaining the idea” to “install the app now.”

---

## **8. Transaction Pasting Flow — Tabbed System**

Create a new tabbed interface for pasting/processing transactions:

### **Tabs:**

1. **M-Pesa PDF Statement (Existing)**

   - Instructions
   - Upload zone

2. **Copy-SMS Guide**

   - Step-by-step
   - Paste SMS text
   - Auto-detect and clean transactions

3. **Bank Statements (Coming Soon)**

   - Tease the feature
   - Build trust
   - Capture future demand

---

## **9. Documentation Cleanup & Final Review**

After implementing the new flow:

- Delete all old docs
- Replace with clean, updated, compact files
- Rebuild a simple, organized README.md

  - Setup
  - Features
  - Pricing
  - Installation
  - Roadmap

---

## **10. Content Strategy for Launch**

Tie everything to the Free Analyzer as the hook.

### **Sample TikTok Concept:**

**“It’s Monday. Can you tell where all your money went?”**

- Upload last 3 days’ statement
- Analyzer shows everything
- Promote Monee as the solution

We’ll rely on expenses analytics as the core of this content.
